// all the exercises should use recursion:

/*
1
Create a function called sum
that takes a single parameter n,
and return the sum of all integers up to n starting from 0

Ex: sum(2); => 2 + 1 + 0 => 3
Ex: sum(5); => 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 => 15
*/


/*
2
Create a function called factorial
that takes a single parameter n,
and return the product of all integers up to n starting from 1

Ex: factorial(2); => 2 * 1 => 6
Ex: factorial(4); => 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 => 24
*/


/*
3
Create a function called repeatStr
that takes 2 parameters string and number,
and return the string number time with space
Important: the stop condition should be [somthing=== 0]
** Think how we can return nothing ???
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end
Ex: repeatStr("to",2); => "to to"
Ex: repeatStr("to",4); => "to to to to"
*/


/*
4
Create a function called fibon
that takes 1 parameter a number,
and return the fibonacci for this number

Ex: fibon(7); => 21
Ex: fibon(2); => 2
Ex: fibon(1); => 1
Ex: fibon(0); => 1

fibon(n): 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
          | | | | | |  |  |
n:        0 1 2 3 4 5  6  7
*/


/*
5
Create a function called sum2
that take two parameter
and will return the sumation from the first number to the second number

Ex: sum2(4, 5); => 4 + 5 => 9
Ex: sum2(3, 6); => 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 => 18
*/


/*
6
Create a function called repeatStr2
that takes 2 string parameters,
and return the first string number time
(of the lenght of the secend string) with space betweeen it
** Important: the stop condition should be [somthing=== 0]
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end

Ex: repeatStr2("ro","cc"); => "ro ro"
Ex: repeatStr2("ro","fff"); => "ro ro ro"
*/


/*
7
Create a function called multiOf
that takes 3 parameters,
and return the first number mutiple by
(the second one ^ the third number)

Ex: multiOf(4,10,3); => 4000
Ex: multiOf(6,3,2); => 54
Ex: multiOf(6,2,3); => 48

*/


/*
8
Create a function called muti2
that take two parameter
and will return the multiplication from the first number to the second number

Ex: muti2(4, 5); => 4 * 5 => 20
Ex: muti2(3, 6); => 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 => 360
*/


/*
9
Create a function called numberBetweenUs
that take 2 parameters
and return the number between them
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end or comma

numberBetweenUs(2,8) => "3, 4, 5, 6, 7"

numberBetweenUs(1,3) => "2"

*/


/*
10
Write a function called countDown
that takes one parameter
and return a string represent the count down from the number
that insert to 0
instead of 0 need to ahve "done"
between each number a comma and space
** you need to use recursion
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end or comma

countDown(5)
=> "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, done"

countDown(2)
=> "2, 1, done"

countDown(7)
=> "7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, done"
*/

/*
11
Write a function called multiplication2
that takes two parameters
and return the multiplication of them
you need to use only sum

multiplication2(5,4) => 20

multiplication2(2,8) => 16

multiplication2(7,6) =>  42
*/

/*
11
Write a function called mod2
that takes two parameters
and return the module of them
without using %
mod2(5,4) => 1

mod2(2,8) => 2

mod2(7,4) => 3
*/


/*
12
Write a function called mirror
that takes one parameter a string
and return the reversed string
**hint: "str"[0] => "s"
**hint: "car"[1] => "a"
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end

mirror("school") => "loohcs"

mirror("car") => "rac"

mirror("maDrasa") => "asarDam"

/*
13
Write a function called mirrorCaseAlso
that takes one parameter a string
and return the reversed string order
and the lower case to upper case
and the upper case to lower case
**hint: seacrh in MDN how "a" => "A" and "A" => "a"
** Important: You should dint have extra space at the end


mirrorCaseAlso("sChOol") => "LOoHcS"

mirrorCaseAlso("THOR") => "roht"

mirrorCaseAlso("BaBa") => "AbAb"

/*
14
Write a function called repeatChar
that takes two parameters

without case sensetive
repeat inside this string
